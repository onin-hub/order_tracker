<!-- initializing git -->
git config --global user.name [username]		- define username
git config --global user.email [email]			- define email
git init 										- initialize git 

<!-- modifying, staging, committing -->
git status 										- show file status if modified, on stage, committed
git add [filename]								- add a file to staging area (staging is simply selecting a file you want to commit)
git add . 										- add all files to staging area
git commit -m [commit name] 					- create a commit
git log											- show log with details
git log --oneline 								- show log in one line

<!-- checkout, revert, reset -->
<!-- use checkout commit to go back in a certain commit point -->
git checkout [commit id] 						- go back to a certain commit point
<!-- use revert commit to undo a certain commit point -->
<!-- after revert, type :wq to exit the revert editor -->
git revert [commit id]							- undo a certain commit point
<!-- use reset commit to permanently delete commit points but preserve current code state -->
git reset [commit id]							- remove all previous commit points
<!-- use hard reset to permanently delete commit points including the code state -->
git reset [commit id] --hard					- remove all previous commit points including code state

<!-- branching -->
<!-- create branch if you want to isolate a new feature from the master branch -->
git branch [branch name]						- create a branch
git branch -a									- show all branches
<!-- * master, an asterisk indicate your current branch your working with -->
<!-- moving to a certain branch -->
git checkout [branch name]						- go to a certain branch
<!-- deleting a branch -->
<!-- before deleting a branch, make sure you are on the master branch -->
<!-- lowercase "d" will only work on merged branch -->
git branch -d [branch name]						- delete merged branch
<!-- use uppercase "D" to delete unmerged branch -->
git branch -D [branch name]						- delete unmerged branch
<!-- use shorthand for creating a branch and checking out at the sametime -->
git checkout -b [branch name]					- create and checkout branch
<!-- merging a certain branch to the master branch -->
<!-- first make sure your on the master branch before merging -->
git merge [branch name]							- merge a branch
<!-- in dealing with conflict, just remove the comment and,
merged the branch on the master branch -->
git merge										- merging the conflict branch

<!-- github -->
<!-- uploading your local repository to remote (github) -->
<!-- first step is to create a remote repo -->
<!-- copy the url of the remote repo -->
<!-- push your local repo to remote -->
git push [repo link] [branch name]				- push local to remote repo
<!-- creating an alias for remote repo link -->
<!-- 'origin' most used remote alias -->
git remote add origin [repo link]				- creating alias for remote repo
git push [alias] [branch name] 					- using the push with alias / nickname
git push --all origin							- push all branch on remote repo

<!-- pulling from remote repo to local -->
<!-- first step is to create a remote repo -->
<!-- second step is to clone the remote repo to your local directory -->
git clone [repo link]							- cloning remote repo
<!-- note: cloned repo already has an alias (origin) -->
git remote -v 									- show alias details

<!-- collaboration on github -->
<!-- fetching files from remote to local repo -->
git pull [alias] [branch name]					- fetching from remote to local

<!-- best practice: 
- work on a new branch for new feature to avoid
messing up with the master branch
- always pull the master branch from remote repo before working on new feature
to stay updated from changes -->

<!-- after you pull your new feature to remote repo,
you have to create a pull request -->

<!-- then you can delete the branch in remote repo if it
is already been merged (optional). -->

<!-- forking from different github repo -->
<!-- first you have to fork the repo from someone's account to your account,
the you can clone it to your local directory -->

<!-- then click new pull request -->
<!-- then on original account create a pull request -->
<!-- then the owner of the repo can now review and merge your changes -->
